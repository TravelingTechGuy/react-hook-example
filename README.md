# React Hook example

The project demonstrates 2 React hooks, `useState` and `useEffect`, in 4 simple React components:

1. App - mounts the app.
2. Locale - allows selecting locale from a list.
3. Time - shows current time according to provided locale, updating every second, until it's unmounted.
4. Editable - allows editing its content, returns the changed value.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
